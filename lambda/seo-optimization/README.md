# SEO Optimization Lambda

## What this lib does?

It implements a simple way of processing HTML via Node.js that it can used in any kind of serverless infrastructure (AWS lambda@edge, Cloudflare Workers, etc.)

## Requirements

- Node.js
- Typescript toolkit (`tsc`)
- (to run locally) `ts-node`

## Run a local test

Run the following

```
ts-node test.js
```

That must generate an optimized version of a test index.html file
